        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It is a beloved culinary masterpiece known for its rich blend of spices, tender meat, and fragrant rice. The dish typically consists of long-grain Basmati rice cooked with succulent pieces of meat, such as chicken, lamb, or goat, although there are also vegetarian versions available. Biryani is infused with a medley of spices, including cumin, coriander, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon, which impart a depth of flavor and complexity to the dish. Additionally, it often features saffron-infused rice, which gives it a vibrant yellow hue and a subtle floral aroma. Biryani is typically layered and cooked in a sealed pot, allowing the flavors to meld together and the meat to become tender and juicy. Garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes boiled eggs, biryani is not just a meal but a culinary experience that delights the senses and brings people together in celebration of its exquisite taste and tradition.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chilli powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>A pinch of ground cloves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground green cardamom</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>If using meat, marinate it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a blend of spices for a few hours or overnight in the refrigerator. This helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavor.</li>
        <li> Wash and soak the Basmati rice for about 30 minutes. Then, cook the rice with whole spices like cloves, cardamom, and bay leaves until it's about 70-80% done. Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the onions and tomatoes. Chop the fresh herbs (cilantro and mint). Soak saffron strands in warm milk.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat ghee or oil and saut√© the sliced onions until golden brown. Add the marinated meat and cook until it's partially done. Then, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.</li>
        <li> In a separate heavy-bottomed pot or pan, layer the partially cooked rice and the cooked meat mixture. Sprinkle each layer with fresh herbs, fried onions, and saffron-infused milk. Repeat the layers until all the rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to prevent steam from escaping. Cook the biryani on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to fully cook.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, gently fluff up the biryani with a fork. Serve hot, garnished with fried onions, boiled eggs, and nuts if desired. Accompany it with raita (yogurt dip) and salad for a complete meal.</li>
